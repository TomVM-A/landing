      <h2>If you have questions</h2>
      <p>Don't stop, study more, here a hint, look on internet poeple that do the same thing that you are doing, and see what they do and try it yourself whit the plus of being you. If there is nobody who do the things you do or you are the one who is in the front of your field then you must try things, but never stop!. Also you can try teach to others in that way you have to think and organize all your knowlege in way that even a 5 years old child can understand what you do, more or less. With that in mind you probably can get new ideas</p>
